# How To Use Ultimate Menu Script
For every Version of the ultimate menu (Kiddion/YimMenu) there is a different use and ways to fully Run It. 

For Kiddions script is just puting the script into scripts directory, inside the Kiddions files.

For YimMenu it is actually the same way, but first before initiating the script you will need to go to Settings > Lua > Open Folder Option 

From There Go To Scripts Folder Then Paste The Ultimate Menu In There
